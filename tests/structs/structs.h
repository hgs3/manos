 *  \brief Record tests.
 *
 *  In computer science, a record (also called a structure, struct, or compound data) is a basic data structure.
 *  Records in a database or spreadsheet are usually called "rows".
 *
 *  A record is a collection of fields, possibly of different data types, typically in a fixed number and sequence.
 *  The fields of a record may also be called members, particularly in object-oriented programming; fields may also be called elements, though this risks confusion with the elements of a collection.
 *
 *  For example, a date could be stored as a record containing a numeric year field, a month field represented as a string, and a numeric day-of-month field.
 *  A personnel record might contain a name, a salary, and a rank.
 *  A Circle record might contain a center and a radiusâ€”in this instance, the center itself might be represented as a point record containing x and y coordinates.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Advance the iterator \f[C]it\f[R] to the boundary following its current position.
The \f[C]pos\f[R] parameter will be populated with the code unit offset of the boundary and whether said boundary is optional or mandatory.
.PP
When \f[B]UNI_DONE\f[R] is returned then the position of the iterator will be immediately beyond the last character in the text being scanned.
This is not the same as the last character.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.TP
UNI_OK
If the break iterator was successfully repositioned.
.TP
UNI_DONE
If the break iterator is beyond the last character in the text being scanned.
.TP
UNI_BAD_OPERATION
If \f[C]it\f[R] is \f[C]NULL\f[R].
